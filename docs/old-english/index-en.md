## Presentation in English

**Learn Continuous Deployment With Static Site Generators**

Description : In this course we will learn how to deploy websites in continuous deployment with static site generators. We will try to understand numerous Web Dev and hosting concepts and to practice them.

[In the first part of this course](first-continous-deployment-project.md), you will learn how to deploy continuously a modern documentation website in HTTPS and CDN for free with Netlify.

[In the secund part of this course](other-projects-with-static-site-generators.md), you will extend our knowledge with other projects.

To maintain our sites we will use **git**, **GitHub**, and **Atom Editor**. To build, deploy, and host our examples we will use **Netlify**. We will use **MkDocs**, **Hugo**, **GitBook** and **Jekyll** as static site generators. We suggest to use **Cloudflare** as DNS Server and **OVH** as Domain Registrar.

This course is the opportunity to review protocols like **HTTP**, **HTTPS/TLS**, **DNS**, but also concepts and architectures like CI/CD, versionning, MVC, HTML, JS, CSS, SEO, CDN, website analytics, ...

There is nothing to pay to use and to deploy those solutions. Only one valid email is required.
