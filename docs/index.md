https://github.com/goffinet/learn-cd-staticgen/

English version in development. There is no French version yet.

[In the first part of this course](first-continous-deployment-project.md), you will learn how to deploy continuously a modern documentation website in HTTPS for free with netlify.

[In the secund part of this course](other-projects-with-static-site-generators.md), we will extend our knowledge with other projects.

To maintain our site we will use **git**, **GitHub**, and **Atom Editor**.

To build, deploy, and host our examples we will use **Netlify**.

We will use **MkDocs**, **Hugo**, **GitBook** and **Jekyll** as static site generators.

There is nothing to pay to use and to deploy those solutions.

The main example try to answer the need of a web documentation system in 10 steps.
